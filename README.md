# ☕ MoKa News

**Morning News** - A beautiful, **GenAI-driven** TUI (Text User Interface) RSS news aggregator that transforms your daily feeds into a single, cohesive morning editorial.

> **Note**: MoKa News is a **GenAI-driven project**. AI was used as a true co-pilot for the initial architecture, coding, and debugging, demonstrating how GenAI can accelerate the development of modern developer tools.

## Architecture

MoKa News now follows a layered architecture so CLI, orchestration, storage, and UI are clearly separated:

- `moka_news/cli` - Argument parsing and first-run setup wizard
- `moka_news/application` - Use-cases and services (fetch, editorial generation, TUI workflows)
- `moka_news/infrastructure` - Config and storage adapters (OPML, trackers, editorial repository)
- `moka_news/models.py` - Typed domain models (`Article`, `Editorial`, metadata)
- `moka_news/tui` - Textual UI implementation
- `moka_news/grinder`, `moka_news/barista`, `moka_news/poster`, `moka_news/publisher` - Core feature modules

### 🔄 The Grinder (Il Macinino)
A Python module using `feedparser` to extract data from RSS feeds. It gathers articles from multiple sources, filters them by date (only new articles since last download), and prepares them for processing.

### 📝 The Editorial Generator (AI-Powered)
Uses AI to create a cohesive morning editorial from multiple articles, combining the most important news into a single, enjoyable reading experience. Editorials are saved as markdown files with source links for future reference.

Supports multiple AI providers:
- **API-based providers:**
  - OpenAI (GPT models)
  - Anthropic (Claude models)
  - Google Gemini (Gemini Pro)
  - Mistral AI (Mistral models)
  - Azure AI Foundry (any deployed model via Azure AI Inference SDK)
- **CLI-based providers:**
  - GitHub Copilot CLI
  - Gemini CLI
  - Mistral CLI
- Simple mode (no AI, for testing)

1. **Select your AI provider** - Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Azure AI Foundry, or CLI-based providers
2. **Configure keywords** (optional) - Set keywords to focus AI editorials on topics you care about
3. **Configure RSS feeds** - Accept our curated list of 5 tech feeds (stored as OPML) or add your own later with `moka-news --add-feed`

Simply run:

```bash
moka-news
```

The wizard will guide you through the setup and create:
- Configuration file at `~/.config/moka-news/config.yaml`
- OPML feeds file at `~/.config/moka-news/feeds.opml`

**Note:** AI providers require API keys (set via environment variables) or CLI tools installed and configured.

## Configuration

MoKa News can be configured in multiple ways:

### 1. First-Run Setup Wizard (Recommended)

On first launch, MoKa News will automatically run an interactive setup wizard to help you:
- Choose your preferred AI provider
- Optionally configure keywords to focus editorials on your interests
- Configure your RSS feeds with our curated tech feed suggestions

Simply run `moka-news` and follow the prompts!

### 2. Configuration File

After the first-run setup, your configuration is saved to `~/.config/moka-news/config.yaml`.

You can also create a configuration file manually:

```bash
# Create a sample configuration file
moka-news --create-config

# This creates 'moka-news.yaml' in your current directory
```

Edit the `moka-news.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Note: RSS feeds are managed via OPML (moka-news --add-feed / --list-feeds),
# not in this YAML file.

# AI Provider Configuration
ai:
  provider: gemini-cli  # Options: openai, anthropic, gemini, mistral, azure, copilot-cli, gemini-cli, mistral-cli
                        # Note: 'simple' mode is for demo/testing only
  cli_timeout_seconds: 240  # Timeout for CLI-based providers (copilot-cli/gemini-cli/mistral-cli)
  
  api_keys:
    openai: your-key-here
    anthropic: your-key-here
    gemini: your-key-here
    mistral: your-key-here
    azure: your-key-here  # Azure AI API key (or AZURE_AI_API_KEY env var)
  
  # Azure AI Foundry settings (only needed when provider: azure)
  azure_endpoint: null   # e.g. https://my-foundry.services.ai.azure.com/models
  azure_model: null      # e.g. Mistral-Large-3, gpt-4o, Llama-3-8B-Instruct
  azure_api_version: 2024-05-01-preview  # default; some models require a different API version
  
  # Keywords for summary generation (optional)
  # These keywords help focus the AI on specific topics or aspects
  keywords:
    - technology
    - artificial intelligence
    - programming
  
  # Editorial Prompts (optional)
  # Customize how the AI generates morning editorials
  editorial_prompts:
    system_message: "You are a skilled news editor creating an engaging morning editorial."
    user_prompt: |
      Create a cohesive morning news editorial from these articles:
      {content}
      
      Write an engaging editorial that highlights important news and
      connects topics into a coherent narrative enjoyable over morning coffee.
    keywords_section: |
      Pay special attention to topics related to: {keywords}

# UI Configuration
ui:
  use_tui: true  # TUI is the primary interface
  theme: rose-pine  # Default theme (dark, relaxing)
  theme_light: rose-pine-dawn  # Light theme option
  theme_dark: rose-pine  # Dark theme option

# Refresh Configuration
refresh:
  allowed_times:
    - "08:00"  # Morning refresh time
    - "20:00"  # Evening refresh time
  max_daily_refreshes: 2  # Maximum number of refreshes per day
  require_confirmation_outside_hours: true  # Ask for confirmation outside scheduled times
  auto_refresh_window: 60  # Time window in minutes around allowed times for automatic refresh
```

**Refresh Configuration:**

MoKa News focuses on editorial quality by limiting refreshes to specific times:
- **Morning refresh:** 8:00 AM - Start your day with fresh news
- **Evening refresh:** 20:00 (8:00 PM) - Catch up on the day's events
- **Auto-refresh window:** 60 minutes around each allowed time (e.g., 7:30-8:30, 19:30-20:30)
- **Manual refresh control:** When you press 'r' outside scheduled hours, you'll be asked to confirm
- **First run:** On the first run, articles from the previous day are fetched to provide initial content

This approach ensures you get quality editorials at predictable times without information overload.

**Theme Configuration:**

MoKa News includes two beautiful, relaxing themes optimized for comfortable reading:
- **Dark theme:** `rose-pine` - Soft purple tones that are easy on the eyes
- **Light theme:** `rose-pine-dawn` - Warm, gentle light theme for daytime reading

Switch between themes anytime by pressing `t` in the TUI!

Other available Textual themes include: `textual-dark`, `textual-light`, `nord`, `gruvbox`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `dracula`, `tokyo-night`, `monokai`, `solarized-light`, `solarized-dark`, and more.

You can place the config file in:
- Current directory: `./moka-news.yaml` or `./.moka-news.yaml`
- User config: `~/.config/moka-news/config.yaml`
- Home directory: `~/.moka-news.yaml`

### 3. Environment Variables

For API-based AI providers, you can set environment variables:

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# For Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

# For Google Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# For Mistral AI
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-api-key-here

# For Azure AI Foundry
export AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key-here
export AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=https://my-foundry.services.ai.azure.com/models
export AZURE_AI_MODEL=gpt-4o  # The deployed model name
export AZURE_AI_API_VERSION=2024-05-01-preview  # Optional override for model compatibility

# For Write.as publishing
export WRITEAS_ALIAS=your-writeas-alias
export WRITEAS_PASS=your-writeas-pass
export WRITEAS_COLLECTION_ALIAS=your-collection-alias
export WRITEAS_API_BASE=https://write.as/api

# For Buttondown publishing
export BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY=your-buttondown-api-key
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root with the same variables.

For Azure AI Foundry, model support can vary by API version. If requests return HTTP 404,
verify endpoint and model name first, then try changing `AZURE_AI_API_VERSION`
(or `ai.azure_api_version` in config) to a version supported by that model/deployment.

### 4. Keywords Configuration

You can configure keywords to help focus AI-generated editorials on specific topics you're interested in.

**During first-run setup:** The setup wizard will prompt you to optionally configure keywords.

**Manual configuration:** Add them to your configuration file:

```yaml
ai:
  keywords:
    - technology
    - artificial intelligence
    - machine learning
    - cybersecurity
    - programming
```

When keywords are configured, the AI will receive these as context when generating editorials:
- The AI will prioritize these topics when creating the morning editorial
- Helps customize editorials to your specific interests
- Optional - the system works perfectly without keywords
- All AI providers support keywords (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Mistral, Azure AI Foundry, CLI variants)

**Example use cases:**
- Focus on specific technologies: `python`, `rust`, `kubernetes`
- Emphasize certain domains: `fintech`, `healthcare`, `education`
- Highlight particular aspects: `security`, `performance`, `user experience`

To see keywords in action, check out the example:
```bash
python examples/keywords_example.py
```

### 5. Command Line Arguments

CLI arguments override both config file and environment variables.

## Usage

### Quick Start

Simply run:

```bash
moka-news
```

On first run, this will launch the setup wizard. On subsequent runs, it will use your saved configuration to fetch and display news with AI-powered editorials.

### Basic Usage

Run with default settings (uses your configured AI provider):

```bash
moka-news
```

### Daemon Mode (No TUI)

Start MoKa News as a detached background service that fetches and generates editorials on the configured refresh schedule (from `refresh.allowed_times`):

```bash
moka-news --daemon
```

The command returns immediately with the daemon PID. Logs are written under `~/.config/moka-news/logs/`.
When daemon mode generates a new editorial, it auto-publishes to all enabled providers in `publish.providers` only if `publish.autosend: true`.

### With Specific AI Provider

Override your configured provider:

**API-based providers:**

Use OpenAI for editorial generation:

```bash
moka-news --ai openai
```

Use Anthropic Claude for editorial generation:

```bash
moka-news --ai anthropic
```

Use Google Gemini for editorial generation:

```bash
moka-news --ai gemini
```

Use Mistral AI for editorial generation:

```bash
moka-news --ai mistral
```

Use Azure AI Foundry for editorial generation:

```bash
moka-news --ai azure
```

**CLI-based providers:**

Use GitHub Copilot CLI (requires `copilot` command available):

```bash
moka-news --ai copilot-cli
```

Use Gemini CLI (requires `gemini` command available):

```bash
moka-news --ai gemini-cli
```

Use Mistral CLI (requires `mistral` CLI):

```bash
moka-news --ai mistral-cli
```

### Demo Mode (No AI)

For testing without AI:

```bash
moka-news --ai simple
```

**Note:** Simple mode is for demo/testing only and does not use AI for editorial generation.

### Custom RSS Feeds

Specify your own RSS feeds on the command line:

```bash
moka-news --feeds https://example.com/feed.xml https://another.com/rss
```

### Feed Management

MoKa News stores your RSS feeds in OPML format for easy management and portability. The first-run wizard will suggest 5 curated tech feeds:

1. **Hacker News** - https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
2. **GitHub Blog** - https://github.blog/feed/
3. **The Verge - Tech** - https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml
4. **TechCrunch** - https://techcrunch.com/feed/
5. **Ars Technica** - https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index

#### Add a feed

```bash
moka-news --add-feed https://example.com/feed.xml
```

#### Remove a feed

```bash
moka-news --remove-feed https://example.com/feed.xml
```

#### List configured feeds

```bash
moka-news --list-feeds
```

#### Custom OPML file location

By default, feeds are stored in `~/.config/moka-news/feeds.opml`. You can specify a custom location:

```bash
moka-news --opml /path/to/custom/feeds.opml
```

The OPML file is stored in standard OPML 2.0 format at `~/.config/moka-news/feeds.opml`, making it compatible with other RSS readers and aggregators.

### Combined Options

```bash
# Use custom config file
moka-news --config myconfig.yaml

# Use OpenAI with custom feeds
moka-news --ai openai --feeds https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While in the TUI:

- `q` or `Ctrl+C` - Quit the application
- `r` - Refresh feed (asks for confirmation if outside scheduled hours)
- `g` - Generate poster from current editorial
- `u` - Publish current editorial to enabled providers
- `h` - Browse past editorials (history)
- `t` - Toggle between light and dark theme

The TUI displays your morning editorial, with easy access to past editorials through the history feature. It automatically refreshes at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM daily. Manual refreshes outside these times will prompt for confirmation to maintain editorial quality. ☕

## Morning Editorial Feature

MoKa News generates a single, AI-powered editorial that combines your news articles into a coherent morning reading experience:

- **Smart Content Selection**: The AI processes all articles filtered by date (since last download) based on your keywords
- **Cohesive Narrative**: Articles are combined into a single, flowing editorial rather than separate summaries
- **Source Links**: All source articles are linked at the end of the editorial
- **Markdown Archive**: Each editorial is saved as a markdown file (default: `~/.config/moka-news/editorials/`)
- **Date-based Filename**: Editorials are saved as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` for easy organization
- **History Access**: Press `h` in the TUI to browse and read past editorials
- **Customizable Prompts**: Fine-tune how the AI generates editorials by customizing prompts in your config file
- **Configurable Location**: Save editorials to any directory of your choice

### Configuring Editorial Settings

You can customize editorial settings in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
editorial:
  # Directory to save editorials (defaults to ~/.config/moka-news/editorials if not specified)
  editorials_dir: ~/Documents/my-news-editorials
  
  # Smart article fetching
  min_articles: 10         # Minimum articles needed for quality editorial
  extended_window_days: 3  # Days to look back if too few recent articles
```

**Smart Article Fetching:**

MoKa News automatically ensures you have enough articles for a quality editorial:
- If fewer than `min_articles` are found in the recent time window, MoKa News automatically expands the search to the last `extended_window_days` days
- This ensures you always get a rich, informative editorial even during slow news periods
- Defaults: 10 minimum articles, 3-day extended window
- Configurable to match your reading preferences

### Customizing Editorial Generation

You can customize the editorial generation by adding `editorial_prompts` to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
ai:
  editorial_prompts:
    system_message: "You are a skilled news editor..."
    user_prompt: |
      Create a cohesive morning news editorial from these articles:
      {content}
      
      [Your custom instructions here]
    keywords_section: |
      Pay special attention to: {keywords}
```

This allows you to fine-tune:
- The editorial style and tone
- How topics are connected
- The level of detail
- Focus areas and priorities

### Gemini CLI Timeout (Troubleshooting)

If you see an error like `gemini CLI timed out`, increase the CLI timeout in your config:

```yaml
ai:
  provider: gemini-cli
  cli_timeout_seconds: 300
```

CLI providers perform one automatic retry on timeout. If both attempts timeout, raise `cli_timeout_seconds` further (for example: `360` or `480`).

### Publishing From The TUI

From the TUI you can publish the current editorial with:
- `u` (keyboard shortcut).

To auto-publish after each refresh in the TUI, set `publish.autosend: true`.

Add this section to `config.yaml`:

```yaml
publish:
  autosend: false  # Auto-publish editorials after refresh in the TUI
  providers:
    - type: writeas
      enabled: true
      api_base: https://write.as/api
      alias: null            # or WRITEAS_ALIAS env var
      pass: null             # or WRITEAS_PASS env var
      collection_alias: my-blog
      font: serif

    - type: buttondown
      enabled: false
      api_key: null          # or BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY env var
      api_base: https://api.buttondown.com/v1
      status: draft
```

All enabled providers are executed on publish.

Example editorial structure:
```markdown
# Your Morning News

*Monday, February 14, 2026 at 08:00*

---

[AI-generated editorial content combining multiple articles...]

---

## Sources

- **Article Title** - *Source Name*
  [https://example.com/article](https://example.com/article)
